# Theory (1) Mamba and Transformer architectures are complementary:

# RNNs are designed for sequences and Transformers for ngram prediction.
# The best versions of these are excellent at both.

# "Mamba" (Gu and Dao, 2023)
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00752.pdf
# Figure 9 shows that adding attention layers improves performance.

# "Is Mamba Capable of ICL?" (Grazzi et al, 2024)
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03170.pdf
# In Figure 2 you can see that sometimes Transformer learns faster,
# and other times Mamba learns faster.
# They find that Mamba has a similar "iterative refinement" behavior.


# Theory (2) Transformer blocks appear to be forming functional pairs:

# "Subformer" (Reid et al, 2021)
# https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.344.pdf
# Shows that "every 2 layers shared" performs much better than all-shared,
# But not much better than less sharing.  So there's something important about pairs.

# "The Truth is in There" (LASER) (Sharma et al, 2023)
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13558.pdf
# Shows that every other layer seems to be low rank in a large language model,
# indicating that pairs of layers are plausible components.

# "PonderNet" (Banino et al, 2021)
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05407.pdf
# Shows that layers can be repeated and performance improves.
# There are previous results that indicate DNNs implement something like
# iterative optimizers, and these benefit from more iterations of course.
# But the "unit" of iteration seems to be pairs of blocks.


# Combining (1) and (2): Pairs of alternating Mamba/Transformer blocks
# is a powerful combination that seems to already benchmark well.
# Running the Transformer first makes sense to me since it grabs information
# from all over the input space and then Mamba can work on it a bit more locally.
